            <ul class="treatment-details">
              <li><b>On April 1st 2024</b>, our son was diangosed with <b>Tumor</b> in right Cerebellum. That was about
                6.7cm x 5.6cm x 3.7cm in size. Because of the growth of this tumor the natural way out of cerebrospinal
                fluid (CSF) was collapsed, and caused the accumlation of fluids around brain with excessive pressure -
                this condition is called <b>Hydrocephalus</b>. Hydrocephalus was an immediate life threating risk and
                that was the cause of enlargement of head.</li>

            <ul class="treatment-details">
              <li><b>On April 2nd 2024</b>, an emergency surgical procedure called <b>VP Shunt placement</b> was
                performed. A tube was put inside our son's body with one end in the head and another in the abdomen, so
                that the excess fluids from head can flow to abdomen, which would naturally exit the body.</li>
              <li><b>On April 7th 2024</b>, started getting fever spikes. The fever was on and off, and that went on for
                more than 2 weeks (beyond April 19th).</li>
              <li><b>On April 19th 2024</b>, admitted to hospital again as the temperature was not going down. After
                conducting various tests on blood, urine and CSF the doctors have identified that the placed VP Shunt
                was not functioning correctly and it's likely blocked because of an infection. Infection needs to be
                treated, and the blocked shunt has to be replaced.</li>
              <li><b>On April 24th 2024</b>, <b>VP Shunt was replaced</b> through another surgical procedure.</li>
              <li>Our son is currently on anti-biotics to treat infection as well, so far no fever and we only pray to

                Astrocytoma is a type of Tumor that grows slowly and thus on the down-side takes a long time to respond
                for Chemotherpy. Considering the age of our son, the only available treatment option is Chemotherpy.
                With Chemotherpy, a range of side effects including lower immunity level, kidney damage and hearing-loss
                can occur, and we only pray that none of these side-effects occur to our son.

                created large clot that completely blocked the vein that takes blood from brain back to heart. Doctors
                have assured that this is not an immediate threat, but will need a treatment in future.
